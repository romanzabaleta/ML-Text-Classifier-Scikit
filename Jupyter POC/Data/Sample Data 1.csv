Listen, laugh, and learn about manhood with Jim Ramos and producer Dale Collver as The Man Card Podcast draws a clear line in the sand between males and men interviewing real men in the arena, living real life, in real time.

Medicine,"The Undifferentiated Medical Student (TUMS) podcast is about helping medical students to choose a medical specialty and plan a career in medicine.  The list of career options available to medical students is large, but the time to explore them all is short.  Moreover, mentorship in medical school is lacking, and many medical students tackle the task of career planning alone, most struggling and almost all clutching to the hope that 3rd year clinical rotations will definitively resolve their remaining uncertainties about how they want to specialize. However, having been distracted by the relentless pace of their pre-clinical curricula and specter of Step 1, 3rd year medical students are eventually confronted with the reality that there are simply too many specialties to explore in one year and that they may not even get to finish their clinical rotations before important decisions about their careers need to be made (e.g., the planning of acting internships) if they are to be competitive applicants.  Thus, mentorless and clinically unexposed, many medical students are forced to make wholly uninformed decisions about their futures.  By interviewing at least one physician from each of the 120+ specialties listed on the AAMC's Careers in Medicine website 1) about their specialty, 2) how they decided this specialty was right for them, and 3) for advice about long-term career planning irrespective of the specialty they went into, this podcast aims to enumerate the details of every specialty and provide virtual mentorship on how best to go about moving past being an undifferentiated medical student."

Intended primarily for elementary through community college educators (but open to all interested parties), this 3 day workshop explored issues surrounding the Global Economy through a series of presentations, discussions, and small group activities. The topic of the Global Economy was examined through the following daily themes:
    * Day 1 ‚Äì Markets, Trade and Globalization
    * Day 2 ‚Äì Impacts of Globalization
    * Day 3 ‚Äì The Current Global Financial Crisis
Experts from The University of Chicago and other institutions from around the U.S. lectured on these themes. Each day attendees received lessons and resources for curriculum building. In addition, an optional full-day curriculum development workshop was held on June 25th.

Who is hotter: Ginger or Mary-Ann? Was Plato really endorsing the Republic as the ideal state? Mixing history, pop culture, rank-punditry, political philosophy, and, at times, shameless book-plugging, Goldberg and guests will have the kinds of conversations we wish they had on cable-TV shout shows. And the nudity will (almost) always be tasteful.

The podcast is equal parts oral history and good old-fashioned kiki. We found that there were few platforms where Drag and Nightlife Artists could talk about their art and themselves in an open and honest way. Most of what is known about these artists comes from videos posted on the Internet or what they experience in bars and clubs. It was clear that there were stories to be told and shared with the world. Our mission is to create a comfortable and safe environment, where these artists can share their histories and experiences.  Ours is a podcast that is meant to serve the drag and nightlife community by capturing the artists‚Äô voices and making them available to the public. Grizzly Kiki is a program for drag enthusiasts, Drag Artists, and everyone in between.  Listen and Join the Party!!"

Natural Sciences,"The modern technologies in medicinal and agricultural biotechnology are powerful tools that can address a wide range of problems.  From improved plants, animals and microbes, the technologies known as genetic engineering (familiarly ""GMOs"") are mostly misunderstood and oftentimes maligned.  These technologies are well regarded by scientists, yet approached skeptically by a concerned public.  The disparity has been conjured by prevalent misinformation on the internet and in activist literature and documentaries. At the same time farmers and scientists have not been good communicators about what the technology is, and isn't. 



The Talking Biotech Podcast is a weekly podcast that provides science-based discussion on current topics.  The discussion is led by Dr. Kevin Folta, a professor with training in these areas and familiarity with the scholarly literature.

Medicine,"Welcome to Yoga Nidra Practice for Deep Relaxation and Life Fulfillment
Yoga Nidra is a deep relaxation and guided meditation that you practice comfortably lying down on your back with your arms by your sides, your palms facing up and your head on a pillow.
Yoga Nidra means conscious and aware sleep. It is that state when you are totally relaxed yet conscious and aware. Similar to when you are just about to fall asleep.
Yoga Nidra practices were developed thousands years ago as a means to achieve the deepest states of inner peace and relaxation. A way to positively impact and recondition your mind's subconscious layers.
Yoga Nidra can help you solve problems and enhance both your intuition and your creativity. It will rejuvenate your body and your mind.
It is said that 30 minutes of Yoga Nidra is equivalent to 3 hours of deep sleep.
It is a powerful and delightful practice that you can do on a daily basis at any suitable time for you.
Stay awake, stay still and ¬†do not sleep.
First take a moment to set an intention, a ""sankalpa"", a resolve for your life.
Something you wish to manifest in any areas of your life or a quality you wish to cultivate/ embody for example: fearlessness, courage, inner peace, fulfillment...etc.
Use either the present or future tense in a simple a simple sentence such as:
"" I am in radiant health and will heal completely""
""I will be successful in all that I undertake""
"" I will awaken my spiritual potential""
The wording should be precise, clear and meaningful for you.
Stay with the same resolve every day until you manifest it, achieve it, embody it.
ENJOY THE JOURNEY."

Performing,"Award-winning anthology series of audio dramas, in the realm of the strange, speculative, and supernatural.  Some episodes include more mature content, but have warning labels."
Literature,"A concoction of twelve stories, The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes is the third book in the original Sherlock Holmes series. It shadows the experiences of detective Sherlock Holmes, an enigmatic genius, as he tries to unravel the mystery of each investigation he partakes in. Set in late 19th century London, the novel not only creates a successful mystery plot, but also circulates through real locations including Hyde Park, the river Thames, St George‚Äôs Church in Hanover Square, as well as adding fictional places to spice things up.  The vibrant reoccurring illustrations of London‚Äôs means of transportation are also worth noting.  

 The novel begins in the famous apartment 221B Baker Street, home to Sherlock Holmes who is visited by clients in need of assistance in resolving various issues. Unsurprisingly, Sherlock Holmes works his magic in order to find a logical solution to each mystery.  Narrated through the perspective of Dr. Watson, Holmes‚Äôs close friend and companion, he serves as a monitor as he accompanies or is given a full account of the sequence of events surrounding investigation details.  Watson then documents each adventure and shares it with the readers which in turn act as memoirs of Holmes‚Äôs achievements. This type of narration only enhances the sense of mystery surrounding each case because of the occasional missing detail and leaves the reader wondering about the next course of action. Interestingly, Holmes offers logical explanations for each of his solutions, but nevertheless manages to keep the audience on their toes. Family fortune, reputation, social status and moral weakness are just some of the themes Doyle explores in his novel of suspense and mystery.  

Doyle‚Äôs use of 19th century English jargon proves to be a delightful read, whilst still maintaining a lucid style easy to follow and understand. For those embarking on their first ever encounter with the pipe-smoking, violin-playing sleuth, this is just the beginning of an unforgettable journey."

The podcast is light, funny with a side of serious. We'll discuss real life, hard, gritty stuff, but will also graze over super important topics like who wins the bachelor or what Justin Beiber is up to.

Philosophy,"(PHIL 176) There is one thing I can be sure of: I am going to die. But what am I to make of that fact? This course will examine a number of issues that arise once we begin to reflect on our mortality. The possibility that death may not actually be the end is considered. Are we, in some sense, immortal? Would immortality be desirable? Also a clearer notion of what it is to die is examined. What does it mean to say that a person has died? What kind of fact is that? And, finally, different attitudes to death are evaluated. Is death an evil? How? Why? Is suicide morally permissible? Is it rational? How should the knowledge that I am going to die affect the way I live my life?

Carlin's rapid-fire staccato voice has been compared to William Shatner after too many espressos. That, plus his penchant for making everyone in the audience mad at him eventually, makes for a witch's brew of a podcast that is not for everyone. But for those craving a deeper intellectual analysis, a less partisan approach and unpredictable outside-the-box revelations, Common Sense with Dan Carlin is a feast for the mind."

Literature,"In this podiobook: From the Reader, Jason Pomerantz:The Wonderful Wizard of Oz has been called ""the first true American fairy tale"" and it richly deserves the title.  The story of Dorothy's epic journey through a strange land, filled with terrifying enemies and loyal allies, resonates today as much as it did when it was first written, at the turn of the last century.You've probably seen the movie countless times, so you might not expect any surprises from the book.  But when you listen, you'll be charmed by how imaginative it is, and in a way that's different from the film.I dearly love the movie, but, in this reading, I've tried to approach the story as if I'd never seen it.  My Dorothy is a little younger than her cinematic counterpart and her trio of beloved friends - The Scarecrow, The Tin Woodsman and The Cowardly Lion - are all just a little sillier.  It's hard to escape from the shadow of the MGM spectacular, but I've done my best.I hope you have as much fun listening as I'm having recording!So sit back, put on your slippers (ruby, silver or whatever color you like) and watch out for flying monkeys!

Fitness & Nutrition,"Clean eating. Low carb. Low fat. Do this not that. Now what? Eating is getting too stuffy and complicated. Throw open your windows to allow a new stream of health, wellness, and peace.

What if you could write a letter to food? Pen to paper, you hash out the love/hate relationship and food‚Äôs undeserving power. Details go back years, to your first childhood diet trying to fit in. How you relate to food chronicles many of your life‚Äôs ups and downs.

In this letter, you examine your dusty food beliefs and wonder which go in the trash, are for others, and which remain in your heart.

What if you wrote this all down and food wrote you back? This is Love, Food.

Food behavior expert and host, Julie Duffy Dillon is rolling up her sleeves to get to the bottom of what is really healthy. This award-winning dietitian seen on TLC‚Äôs My Big Fat Fabulous Life has a secret: food is not your enemy and your body is tired of the constant attacks. 

Show topics include:

emotional eating
weight concerns
binge eating
orthorexia
body image
eating disorders
dieting
parenting and food
healthy eating
stress eating
food addiction
mindful eating
non diet approaches

Pull up a chair to your dusty kitchen table and set it for a meal. Ask food to sit alongside you and chat over coffee. Or a margarita. You have some reconnecting to do. In that connection is Love, Food. In that conversation is health and peace."

Believing that something is only as valuable as what someone is willing to pay for it, I determined to test the market using solely eBay for sales, and along the way, building a list of contacts who are interested in my work.

Since I do good work, and a day of good work ought to be worth at least $100, I start each auction with a minimum bid of $100.

Social Sciences,"UPDATE: This Human Sexuality course has been updated and the new series will be available Spring 2015. The new series contains much of the same information, but any discussion of mental health issues will be based on the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5) published by the American Psychiatric Association in May 2013.

Comprehensive review of the biological, emotional and psychological aspects of human sexual behavior. 

The following topics will be covered:
Perspectives on Sexuality 
Conception, Pregnancy & Childbirth
Sex Research: Methods & Problems 
Birth Control and Contraception
Female Sexual Anatomy/Physiology 
Sexuality Over the Life Span
Male Sexual Anatomy/Physiology 
Sexual Health Issues
Gender and Gender Roles 
Sexual Difficulties
Sexual Arousal and Response 
Sexual Satisfaction
Love and Intimacy 
Sexually Transmitted Diseases
Communication in Sexual Behavior 
Atypical Sexual Behavior
Sexual Expression 
Sexual Victimization
Sexual Orientation 
Sex Laws
Sexually Explicit Materials

The material in this series related to mental health diagnoses is based on the American Psychiatric Association's Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition, Text Revision which was published in 2000.

The podcasts include live lecture recordings and pre-recorded segments that focus on frequently asked questions and concepts that often provide a challenge for many students. PDF files or handouts may be included to further enhance the students' understanding of the field of human sexuality. These materials are intended to supplement the traditional classroom approach of my courses and to enhance the students' learning experience.

Target audience should include current students and others who wish to know more about the topic areas. The materials will not be textbook specific so that they will be useful to others. For HACC students, the purpose is to allow them an opportunity to review or catch up on lectures/class periods that they may have missed or misunderstood. For other learners outside of HACC, the purpose is to supply another resource for their learning that is both entertaining and educational.

The course was originally recorded during the Spring Semester 2013 with some updates as necessary.

Please send any suggestions/feedback to drbailey@hacc.edu.

I hope you enjoy listening and thanks for exploring the world of human sexuality with me."

Food,"The purpose of this podcast is to share the stories and food recipes of the people who uncover our shared past-the field archaeologist. The field archaeologists is a unique individual. Their work is to excavate, recover, and survey our human past. In some sense they are modern-day nomads following the seasonal cycle of available work across the globe. Like all nomads they have few personal possessions and only live at one location for a short period of time. This non-traditional life is challenging in terms of having a ‚Äúnormal life‚Äù but with it comes unique experiences that few people get to enjoy. For the field archaeologist one of the most important experiences of their day is the shared evening meal.

The evening meal is probably the most important part of the day. This is when everyone comes together and shares food. Like traditional family meals this is when the day is discussed, stories are shared, and food is enjoyed.

Food is culture. It defines who we are and it is one of the cultural artifacts that brings people together. For the field archaeologist there are memories involved in the making and eating food that we the editors of this blog believe that are important to share with the world. What better way to learn and experience archaeology then from the women and men doing the hard work- the field archaeologist!"

Since 2005 the podcast has evolved to focus on finding inspiration in the ordinary, using it to kick start the process of making stuff, and finding ways to carve out the creative time and space that allows you to work your ass off on the projects that matter most to you.

Social Sciences,"UPDATE: This Abnormal Psychology course uses the diagnostic criteria presented in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition, Text Revision (DSM-IV-TR) published by the American Psychiatric Association in 2000.  In May 2013, the APA released a new edition, the DSM-5 which has significantly impacted the multiaxial system presented in this series and has significantly impacted some of the diagnostic categories and diagnoses.  An updated podcast series based on the new DSM-5 were made available in Spring 2015. 

This course is intended to provide a survey of theories and etiology of abnormal behavior and its social significance; description of symptoms; consideration of techniques of therapy and theories of prevention.

The material in this series related to mental health diagnoses is based on the American Psychiatric Association's Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition, Text Revision which was published in 2000.

The podcasts presented in this series will include live class recordings of lecture presentations and additional pre-recorded segments that focus on frequently asked questions and concepts that often provide a challenge for many students.  These recordings may also be supplemented by PDF files or handouts designed to further enhance the student‚Äôs understanding of the field of abnormal psychology.  These materials are intended to supplement the traditional classroom approach of my courses and to enhance the student‚Äôs learning experience.

Target audience should include current students and others who wish to know more about the topic areas. The materials will not be textbook specific so that they will be useful to others. For HACC students, the purpose is to allow them an opportunity to review or catch up on lectures/class periods that they may have missed or misunderstood. For other learners outside of HACC, the purpose is to supply another resource for their learning that is both entertaining and educational.

The course was originally recorded during the Fall Semester 2010 with some updates as necessary.

Please send any suggestions/feedback to drbailey@hacc.edu.

I hope you enjoy listening and thanks for exploring the world of abnormal psychology with me. "

Business News,"Goal: One stop location to find accounting information, help, and training. Differentiation ‚Äì 1) Large comprehensive selection of topics including financial accounting, managerial accounting, tax, and small business tips. 2) Use of trial balance and chart of accounts including an explanation to understand more concepts as they relate to the accounting process as a whole, including the double entry accounting system, the chart of accounts, and debits and credits. Many books and resources focus on very limited aspects of a topic leaving us with little understanding of how it fits into the double entry accounting system, how it relates to debits and credits, and how it would be journalized to a trial balance. We make an effort to show these accounting relationships. 

Learning Philosophy ‚Äì Accounting is learned best by doing. Much of accounting should be learned with the use of electronic spreadsheets such as Excel or Google Sheets. Learning accounting is also the best way to learn how to use electronic spreadsheets. These are not 2 separate activities to be learned in isolation from each other, but rather they should be learned at the same time, so open up Excel or sign up to a free Google Sheets account and let‚Äôs work some problems.

Objectives:

‚Ä¢ Provide learning resources to any user including accounting students, users who work in an accounting department or firm, or anybody who wants to learn more about accounting, and or, Excel

‚Ä¢ Allow users to locate what they need in a quick and easy way

‚Ä¢ Provide example problems which break down concepts into learnable parts

‚Ä¢ Provide example problems that explain the use of electronic spreadsheets like Excel so that users can learn how to use these applications within a practical context

‚Ä¢ Provide lectures that discuss accounting topics

‚Ä¢ Provide reading material to explain accounting topics"

Business News,"Ryan Fletcher. Welcome to the Agent Marketing Syndicate Podcast. It‚Äôs an unfortunate truth, but ‚ÄúThe Guru Party,‚Äù made up of the trainers, brokers & endless supply of coaches‚Äîand what they teach‚Äîare the architects responsible for bankrupting the real estate industry of trust. Because of them. The term ‚Äúreal estate agent,‚Äù in the eyes of society, has become a stain on your reputation. This podcast is the solution. As you know, I‚Äôve been blessed. I‚Äôve had so many wonderful things happen to me. And I‚Äôve made wonderful things happen by virtue of the opportunities available to me, and by ‚Äúseeing‚Äù the clearing through the fog. The Guru Party‚Äôs message, though, is that you must hunt and beg and demean yourself in a variety of ‚Äústandard‚Äù ways to be successful in real estate. Like, ‚ÄúProspecting is your job.‚Äù I reject that. The spirit of the Entrepreneur knows no limits. It would be shameful to waste it on prospecting. An activity of such low-status. To rise to new heights, though, you must understand the truths that enable you to defy ‚Äúthe gravity‚Äù that others tell you cannot be escaped. They are wrong. Their ‚Äòlack of skills‚Äô and ‚Äòlimited ambition‚Äô blinds them to what is possible. This podcast, undoubtedly, will infuriate The Guru Party. They will reject it. That‚Äôs Ok. By the majority of low-information agents too, it will be rejected. Again, that's OK‚Ä¶ because in time, after enough pain is experienced and suffered, enough struggle is endured, enough frustration is dealt with‚Äîthey will come around. They will smarten up. They will wise up. They will realize The Guru's Party's approach has failed them for fundamental reasons. And they will stop trying to deny or outflank the reality of the truths presented on this podcast. They are, after all, undeniable‚Ä¶truths. For more, visit: www.FightTheGuruParty.com"

Medicine,"My name is Dave Denniston. I started podcasting in 2014 as my way of paying back physicians for helping my family with our miracle child, Evangeline, who was born at a mere 12.4 ounces/ 23 weeks gestationally.

Through this journey, I've had the honor of interviewing Dr. Jim Dahle (The White Coat Investor), Dr. Kevin Pho (KevinMD), Dr. Pamela Wible, Dr. Dike Drummond, Dr. Nii Darko, and so many more.

This is my personal podcast, dedicated to physicians. It is focused on ‚Äúfinancial freedom‚Äù and just as importantly,  how physicians can engage in healthy & a prosperous mindset! My philosophy is that we can all learn from others and who better to talk to physicians than other physicians and experts in various areas!

I want to see every physician lower their taxes, destroy their debt, and enjoy a joyous, liberated lifestyle so that they can focus on what they love most- their families, their patients, and the activities that give them joy.

I speak and interview folks on a whole host of issues that are important to physicians- burnout, how to protect their families, divorce, taxes, medical school debt, how to be a blogger & author, how to start an independent practice, and much more. I also occasionally speak about the resources that I am discovering.

My goal is to create insightful, relevant content that you can put to work in your personal and professional life. If you are a physician- or aspire to be- then this podcast is for you!

I typically post once per week, sometimes more often. Make sure to subscribe and stay tuned. The best is yet to come!"

Sexuality,"The podcast version of the audiobook My Life on the Swingset: Adventures in Swinging & Polyamory.



Starting with a first date with a couple of swingers, followed by working through social anxiety and shyness, recognizing the importance of touch in life, evolving feelings about love and expectations, having threesomes, orgies, and prostate orgasms, going through a divorce, and leveling up in life and sexuality.



For five years, Cooper S. Beckett has written for Life on the Swingset. The website was born out of the feeling that he‚Äôd learned enough in his whole year of swinging to tell other people how to live their non-monogamous lives. His hubris can be seen from space. Here he has collected personal essays, stories, erotica, and prescriptive ‚Äúhow-tos‚Äù into this memoir of his life on The Swingset.



He may be biased when it comes to swinging, polyamory, and other forms of ethical non-monogamy (in fact, he most certainly is) but he doesn‚Äôt sugar-coat it. He speaks honestly and earnestly about a unique way to live life, one that allows for sexual and loving growth and experimentation, a strong sense of community, and the ability to do what we all crave whether we know it or not: Be honest with ourselves and others about what we want sexually. And out of life."

Some may think that having the label of borderline personality disorder is a mark of shame, disparaging those who bear the diagnosis by the implicative nature of the term borderline personality itself, but I can honestly say that the day I received the diagnosis of borderline personality disorder was one of the best days of my lives. The reason is that in giving my problems a definite term that before was simply referred to by likewise unaware friends and family as me being a drama queen gave me the information I needed to find dialectical behavior therapy that taught me the skills I needed to stay alive, act effectively, think without unnecessarily judging myself or others and ultimately gave me the power to change my life. For this reason, I want everyone to know that I have borderline personality disorder, and I am not ashamed. Please show your support of May being Borderline Personality Disorder Awareness Month by sharing my or your own personal story of BPD with friends, family, co-workers, any and all. Where there is an awareness there is hope."

Self-Help,"The Live Awake podcast helps bring you back to your grounded center through reflection and guided meditation. 

This podcast lends a new outlook to some of life's hard landscape. Perspective is everything, and by choosing to live awake to all that blooms in front of us we begin to live a more empowered life where joy becomes our natural state of being rather than something we occasionally stumble upon.  Through living awake we become conscious participants in our life‚Äôs unfolding.

At the end of each episode you will be guided through a short meditation on the topic at hand to help loosen the spots we can feel victim to. By doing this we come to understand we can choose not our usual, painful unconscious habits but instead to live from a place of grounded awareness, free from suffering.  

Live awake is for all those devoted to their hearts, devoted to the soul behind their ribs that came here to grow and expand, to all those devoted to learning, respecting and honoring the ways they are being called to do so. 

It is a place where one can come to close their eyes and rest a while on their breath, and see all they trouble and toil alongside is truly a gold lined cloud, holding a message of great hope and learning cradled within it."

Self-Help,"Dr. Timothy A. Pychyl, associate professor of psychology and director of the Procrastination Research Group (Carleton University, Ottawa, Canada), provides a series of short talks, interviews and question/answer podcasts that explain why we procrastinate and what we can do about it.  An award winning educator, Dr. Pychyl challenges his listeners to explore their daily choices to act or postpone acting on their intentions. Do we head to the gym as intended, or slouch back on the couch thinking ""I'll feel more like a workout tomorrow""? Do we tackle the task now, or do we avoid it arguing to ourselves that ""I work better under pressure""? From losing 10 pounds to changing personal habits, Pychyl, a personality psychologist, focuses on the breakdown of intentional action - a problem commonly called procrastination. This series expands on three main themes: 1) irrational delay that sabotages personal productivity, 2) personality attributes that contribute to self-defeating behaviours, and 3) situational factors that undermine our ability to take or sustain action.  Drawing on the research literature, topics include: self-handicapping, anxiety, self-regulation, perfectionism, will power, coping styles, effects on health and well-being, impulsivity, temporal discounting, motivation and even purpose in life. Of course, Dr. Pychyl doesn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t leave his listeners with the problem itself. Once these key factors have been established, he turns his attention to techniques that facilitate self change, habit-breaking implementation intentions, as well as strategies that help each of us to √¢‚Ç¨≈ìcarpe diem!√¢‚Ç¨?  The emphasis is on self-understanding, practical advice and tools for change. We guarantee that you will find this an engaging series of podcasts that will provide you with tactics to increase personal productivity and well-being."

Social Sciences,"The Fat Lip is a podcast for and about fat people.

In some ways fat people are living in a different world than our thin and average-sized peers. Our lives and our experiences are influenced by our fatness all the time, but the outside reactions to fatness can really f**k us up. On a daily basis we are exposed to media that tells us that we‚Äôre not worthy of representation and a multi-billion dollar diet industry that is happy to take our money (for products that are proven to not work) while barely disguising its disgust at our very existence. It‚Äôs gross, and we‚Äôre over it.

TFL strives to be fat positive in a world that often isn‚Äôt. We are proud supporters of radical self-love and the fierce defense of your body autonomy.  Fat is not an indicator of health or fitness, and health and fitness aren‚Äôt moral imperatives anyway. You don‚Äôt have to justify your body or your health to anyone!

On The Fat Lip, you an expect frank discussion of fat issues in popular media, exploration of fatphobia as it intersects with other forms of oppression, real stories about living, working, and dating in a fat body, big serious topics like the politics of the &amp;amp;quot;obesity epidemic&amp;amp;quot; and tiny fun topics like fatshion and snacks. Plus a whole lot more!"

Philosophy,"The Politics, by the ancient Greek philosopher Aristotle, is one of the most influential texts in political philosophy. In it, Aristotle explores the role that the political community should play in developing the virtue of its citizens. One of his central ideas is that ‚ÄúMan is a political animal,‚Äù meaning that people can only become virtuous by active participation in the political community. Aristotle also criticizes his teacher Plato, classifies and evaluates six different types of constitutions and political institutions, and describes his vision of the ideal state. Aristotle‚Äôs views on women and slavery are unenlightened by today‚Äôs standards, but his work remains enduring and relevant to this day."

National,"Podcast interviews with health policy experts on timely subjects.

The Healthcare Policy Podcast website features audio interviews with healthcare policy experts on timely topics.

An online public forum routinely presenting expert healthcare policy analysis and comment is lacking.  While other healthcare policy website programming  exists, these typically present vested interest viewpoints or do not combine informed policy analysis with political insight or acumen. Since healthcare policy issues are typically complex, clear, reasoned, dispassionate discussion is required.  These podcasts will attempt to fill this void.   

Among other topics this podcast will address:
√¢‚Ç¨¬¢Implementation of the Affordable Care Act
√¢‚Ç¨¬¢Other federal Medicare and state Medicaid health care issues 
√¢‚Ç¨¬¢Federal health care regulatory oversight, moreover CMS and the FDA
√¢‚Ç¨¬¢Healthcare research 
√¢‚Ç¨¬¢Private sector healthcare delivery reforms including access, reimbursement and quality issues
√¢‚Ç¨¬¢Public health issues including the social determinates of health  

Listeners are welcomed to share their program comments and suggest programming ideas.

Comments made by the interviewees are strictly their own and do not represent those of their affiliated organization/s."

Local,"I work to bring you relevant information about Apex, North Carolina.

I want to tell you what's going on... to fill the void left by the print media... partially filled by social media... but so you can hear it from a voice that, hopefully, you've come to trust by now to give it to you straight... but in a manner you've come to expect from living in the #1 Best Place to Live in America.

I want to bring you some real people stories that happen right here in Apex. Some of you may remember the Western Wake Herald, later the Apex Herald. They covered this kind of local news. Well, I see that as a lost art. So I'll be bringing this back to you, but with modern technology... namely, this podcast. Sorry I can't afford to print newspapers, but maybe this is more personal. Yeah, I think that's what I'm going for here.

Lastly, I want to update you on, what some may consider the mundane, others may take it quite seriously, and still others just bring their popcorn and watch for entertainment. Yes, that's right, I'm talking about the Apex town council meetings. And as mayor, I do run the meetings, but I've noticed that there is no one out there telling you what happened... at least, not consistently, and without an angle. And, yeah, I realize as the mayor, you might be thinking, ""Well, what's YOUR angle, Lance?"".

So let's make this clear... my commitment to you is that I'll make sure I tell you when I'm giving you my take on some development request or ordinance change or whatever. If I don't say otherwise, I'm just going to give it you straight -- part news anchor, part friend. But since I'm there at every meeting, I figure, I might as well share with you what we did.

So that's where we're going on this Podcast journey. I hope you will give me a few episodes of support, feedback, constructive criticism and maybe even a bit of grace while I get this thing launched.

Why do I call this The Apex Roundup Podcast? Well, my goal is to make this a 30-minute rodeo for you... every couple of weeks ... rounding up all Apex tidbits. So, the Apex Roundup Podcast seems like a good name that, don't you think?"

Self-Help,"The science of the good life, huh? Sorry this is not about booze, sex and rock n'roll (or whatever is en vogue right now).   In fact we talk about a lot of things that tree huggers would love: appreciation of beauty, gratitude, positive emotions, relationships and well, love. However we, that is positive psychologists and positive psychology practitioners buried ourselves in books, set out to experiment and then write it all up in a writing style that is about as exciting to read as watching an avocado turn brown. And that's the problem: if you are not an academic you probably want a little bit more excitement, than pages and pages of densely written journals can provide. Even if you are an academic, who has time to read all the interesting stuff out there anyways? So in an effort to save your eyes taking on a comically rectangular shape the positive psychology podcast brings the science of the good life to your earbuds. It's not all treehugger style though; sometimes we might get quite serious, for example when exploring things like post-traumatic growth or positive parenting. Subscribe if you want to benefit from the scientific insights into happiness and meaning while you are on the go. Let me know where you are while you are listening to this.

Performing,"Embrace your inner expatriate and come away to this new wild west where we live free in our off-grid paradise commune nestled in the green valley of a mountain range jutting out of the sea. No rules. Plenty of consequences.

About the place, Mollyville...
Rich with cutting-edge technology and abundant in natural resources, Mollyville thrives as a self-policing, paradise community with beaches, cliffs, exotic forests and a system of unknowably vast subterranean caverns that extend beyond sight. Social media is a construct of the past. No emails. No smart phones. No telephones.

It's a whole new world separated from ours by distance, exclusion from world maps, and self-reliance. Mollyville is completely off-the-grid.

The tenet in mollyville is ‚ÄúNothing living shall go without love, companionship or care‚Äînot a snake, not a tree, not a house‚Äînot ever.‚Äù 

It is a covenant all residents have agreed to uphold on a personal level at all times.

Mollyvillian culture is unique in the way that there‚Äôs no formal law enforcement, but rather an integrity-based peacekeeping by way of calling for ‚Äòa recognizing‚Äô when it‚Äôs deemed by influential members of the community that the peace and/or safety of Mollyville is threatened. In this instance, a fluctuating, self-assigned faction of residents take on roles of marauders to exact (a sometimes brutal) satisfaction, making a demand of retribution on behalf of the perceived victims or the community at large, and redistributing their wealth to those who are esteemed to be the most deserving under the circumstances, which sometimes but not always results in the deaths of the targets‚Äîthough, this happens only in the most extreme cases of offense to the community. Freedom is recognized as one of many inalienable rights and the culture dictates residents give each other a wide berth, tolerating all but some transgressions in the name of keeping the peace.


About the story‚Ä¶ 
Bj√∏rn Olsen, a healing psychopath in the golden years of self-recovery, struggles to maintain his cool in the idyllic seaside commune of Mollyville. Plagued by rotten adult children, a careless promiscuous wife, and a vindictive ex-girlfriend, Bj√∏rn finds himself struggling against his dark side to stay in the light.

Infuriated by his blackmailing son and fueled by his own jealousy, he hunts his wife‚Äôs used-to-be best-friend at the local bar and makes the terrible mistake of approaching her. He had no idea she‚Äôd become so bitter. Shouting allegations, she causes a scene.

As the salacious gossip rips through Mollyville, whispers of ‚Äòa recognizing‚Äô bleed through the community, Bj√∏rn begins to fear that he, his wife Eva‚Äîand maybe all of the Olsens are targets for murder.

Miles away, new arrivals to Mollyville, Janik and Nohl, two dodgy grifters tired of selling ‚Äòsensual massages‚Äô and asking for rooms and food on credit, decide to give up their lives of petty crime, allowing themselves to be mentored in the hopes of making Mollyville their new home. Plateau Nick, a crazy artist who prefers life in the forest, offers them a better way of life, and it looks promising, but they are soon to discover that‚Äîjust like every other place they‚Äôve been‚Äîthere will be a price to pay.

Cast of Characters (partial)

Bj√∏rn Olsen
Middle-aged. Healing psychopath in his golden-years of self-recovery. Still has urges but no longer struggles with his desire to act upon them. He‚Äôs got his life the way he wants it. As he suspected, his ability to resist violence and the behavior patterns that lead him to it increased once he brought balance into his life through physical fitness, meditation and a loving romantic relationship with a woman he respects and admires.

No longer a playboy but still a romantic, Bj√∏rn pushes his own boundaries in his quest to satiate his curiosity about a dangerous beauty he‚Äôs been"

Automotive,"It was the fall of 2012. My wife and I were on a ride down to Encinitas, Ca. with some close friends. We were having some dinner and talking about bikes, riding, and other aspects of chopperin'. My brothers wife leans over and says, ""You should do a blog or podcast; something about choppers and interview people or something.""
My initial reaction was and I quote ""Lamest idea ever."" There were/are many excuses why I didn't want to start one, but I couldn't really come up with a valid reason why I shouldn't. Then it hit me... I love motorcycles, mostly noisy, greasy, oil leaking, hand built, choppers, but none the less I love them. After attending my first Born Free, meeting various people, and having an all around great time I realized that I wanted to share this love of two wheels and the people behind the machines with the world.
Chopper Prophets was born almost literally over a 24 hour period, but for everything to come together, it's been quite a ride. As I've recorded casts, read articles, blogs, Instagram posts, and met new people, I've felt this ever increasing desire to spread the gospel of chop. Not just the bikes, the builders, and the events, but the people. The people are what make this culture what it is and they are as unique as the bikes they build and/or ride.
It's not just about those who build or ride though. Chopperin' is a mental state that says ""I know how it's supposed to be, but I'm going to do it this way."" There are very few differences between a hacker and someone who has this mind set. They both end with something being taken apart and modified. I think that's what I love most of all about the culture.
So, here we are now. The Voice of Chopper Culture... or at least attempting to be."

History,"If you listened to The Fall Line prior to 12/17, you haven't heard the complete reworking of season 1 (writing, editing, recording)--check it out.


The Fall Line Podcast is a true-crime audio serial focused on marginalized communities in Georgia, and covers one story per season. Sometimes we investigate, sometimes we reveal--but we're always telling stories of people who have been passed over by mainstream media.
All seasons are numbered by season. For example, Season 1: Episode 1, etc. Updates are also labeled by season. There is additional parenthetical designation (Millbrook Twins or Bennett Siblings) so you don't get confused!
The first season investigates the March 18, 1990 disappearance of Augusta, GA twins Dannette and Jeannette Millbrook. The twins, who were fifteen at the time, were treated without cause as runaways and their case was closed less than a week after their seventeenth birthday.
Season 1.5 covers the case of missing Brunswick, GA siblings Monica and Michael Bennett. Michael and Monica disappeared on June 21, 1989 and were long considered runaways--that is, until their case was reclassified in the early 2000s.
Season 2, out this fall, covers seven infant abductions that occurred in Atlanta, GA, from 1978-1996.

Natural Sciences,"Rationally Speaking is the bi-weekly podcast of New York City Skeptics. Join hosts Massimo Pigliucci and Julia Galef as they explore the borderlands between reason and nonsense, likely from unlikely, and science from pseudoscience. Any topic is fair game as long as we can bring reason to bear upon it, with both a skeptical eye and a good dose of humor!

We agree with the Marquis de Condorcet, who said that in an open society we ought to devote ourselves to ""the tracking down of prejudices in the hiding places where priests, the schools, the government, and all long-established institutions had gathered and protected them.""

Rationally Speaking is produced by Benny Pollak and is recorded in the heart of New York City's Greenwich Village."

Business News,"Welcome to the audio podcasting home of Saifedean Ammous and The Bitcoin Standard.


When a pseudonymous programmer introduced ‚Äúa new electronic cash system that's fully peer-to-peer, with no trusted third party‚Äù to a small Online mailing list in 2008, very few paid attention. Ten years later, and against all odds, this upstart autonomous decentralized software offers an unstoppable and globally-accessible hard money alternative to modern central banks.¬†The Bitcoin Standard¬†analyzes the historical context to the rise of bitcoin, the economic properties that have allowed it to grow quickly, and its likely economic, political, and social implications.¬†


While bitcoin is a new invention of the digital age, the problem it purports to solve is as old as human society itself: transferring value across time and space. Ammous takes the listener on an engaging journey through the history of technologies performing the functions of money, from primitive systems of trading limestones and seashells, to metals, coins, the gold standard, and modern government debt. Exploring what gave these technologies their monetary role, and how most lost it, provides the listener with a good idea of what makes for sound money, and sets the stage for an economic discussion of its consequences for individual and societal future-orientation, capital accumulation, trade, peace, culture, and art. Compellingly, Ammous shows that it is no coincidence that the loftiest achievements of humanity have come in societies enjoying the benefits of sound monetary regimes, nor is it coincidental that monetary collapse has usually accompanied the collapse of a civilization.¬†


With this background in place, the book moves on to explain the operation of bitcoin in a functional and intuitive way. Bitcoin is a decentralized, distributed piece of software that converts electricity and processing power into indisputably accurate records, thus allowing its users to utilize the Internet to perform the traditional functions of money without having to rely on, or trust, any authorities or infrastructure in the physical world. Bitcoin is thus best understood as the first successfully implemented form of digital cash and digital hard money. With an automated and perfectly predictable monetary policy, and the ability to perform final settlement of large sums across the world in a matter of minutes, Bitcoin's real competitive edge might just be as a store of value and network for final settlement of large payments - a digital form of gold with a built-in settlement infrastructure.


Ammous' firm grasp of the technological possibilities as well as the historical realities of monetary evolution provides for a fascinating exploration of the ramifications of voluntary free market money. As it challenges the most sacred of government monopolies, bitcoin shifts the pendulum of sovereignty away from governments in favor of individuals, offering us the tantalizing possibility of a world where money is fully extricated from politics and unrestrained by borders.

Careers,"Firmsconsulting maintains a 80% success rate at placing clients within McKinsey, BCG and Bain. This is the highest in the industry and the rate is higher if we include other firms. We achieve this rate because we only use former partners from McKinsey, BCG et al to develop our clients. This makes us unique. We never use analysts, associates, engagement managers or associate principals. We also carefully select and develop clients on their communication, image, technical and case interview skills. This podcast channel describes our lessons from training our clients.

Performing,"Lux Radio Theatre   1934-1955

This was one of few sixty-minute broadcasts and was the most important dramatic show in radio. The 931 episodes broadcast were all based on popular films with the biggest stars of Hollywood playing the parts and during its heyday the audience was estimated as high as forty million.

The one-and-only Cecil B. DeMille was your host (1936-45) for a lavish production of what was to become a veritable film checklist of many of Hollywoods best films from the mid-30s right through the mid 50s. Every genre is included, from darkest noir crime dramas to historical epics to bubbly musicals and broad comedies. There are some titles that are less known today, and that makes them even more historical.

The stars of the movie are usually in the productions, although sometimes contracts or schedules meant that another star took the part. In some another star would be featured in one of the major roles. The productions were live, with full orchestra, and many Hollywood legends were unused to performing in public without the benefit of retakes. Needless to say, the performances in every show are singular.

The Lux Radio Theatre is a masterpiece in OTRs crown, and each show is a historical time capsule that takes us back to the glamour of the Golden Age of Hollywood."

Social Sciences,"Mindful Recovery is a podcast devoted to helping individuals who are struggling with trauma and addictions recover.  Mindfulness is a research based method for dealing with anxiety and trauma.  Psychological and neuroscience studies have found that it is possible to increase the growth of neuronal pathways and retrain our brains in coping with these issues.  Basic techniques like learning to pay attention to our own breathing and looking honestly and non-judgmentally at our hurt places can begin to create an emotional holding space that allows us to live without reacting to the pain and begin deciding how we want to act on the world we find ourselves in.  This becomes the beginning of recovery and, thus, the beginning of a new and abundant life in recovery.  Whether you struggle with anxiety, mental illness, complex trauma, PTSD, addictions or a multitude of other problems, becoming mindful in the way you live is the first step along that path.  I would be honored if this podcast could help you begin that journey."

Meanwhile Perry Dawsey - a hulking former football star now resigned to life as a cubicle-bound desk jockey - awakens one morning to find several mysterious welts growing on his body. Soon Perry finds himself acting and thinking strangely, hearing voices . . . he is infected.

The fate of the human race may well depend on the bloody war Perry must wage with his own body, because the parasites want something from him, something that goes beyond mere murder.

Infected is the first major print release from Internet phenom Scott Sigler, whose podcast-only audiobooks have drawn an immense cult following, with more than three million individual episodes downloaded. Now Sigler storms the bookstore shelves with this cinematic, relentlessly paced novel that mixes and matches genres, combining horror, technothriller, and suspense in a heady mix that is equal parts Chuck Palahniuk, Michael Crichton, and Stephen King.

Infected will crawl beneath your skin and leave fresh blood on every page.

QUOTES: 
""Part Stephen King, part Chuck Palahniuk, Infected blends science fiction and horror into a pulpy masterpiece of action, terror, and suspense. Three recommendations: don't read it at night, or just after you've eaten a full meal, or if you're weak of heart. You've been warned!""
--James Rollins, New York Times bestselling author of The Judas Strain and Black Order

""Sigler is masterful at grabbing the reader by the throat and refusing to let go. Just when I thought I knew what abyss he was leading me across, he knocked the bridge out from under... I think I screamed the whole way down... Infected is a marvel of gonzo, in-your-face, up-to-the-minute terror.""
--Lincoln Child, New York Times bestselling author of Deep Storm and Death Match

""Sigler is the Richard Matheson of the 21st Century...smart and creepy, Infected is a flawless thinking-person's thriller. Bravo to a bold new talent!""
--Jonathan Maberry, Bram Stoker Award-winning author of Bad Moon Rising and Ghost Road Blues

""Horror mavens rejoice! Infected is a revelation -- a novel that lives up to its hype. From page one, the story of a mysterious smart-virus that turns its hosts into deadly drooling drones creeps up on a reader like the ratchet of a roller coaster climbing toward its inevitable crest. Sigler brings the folksy character detail of Stephen King, the conceptual panache of Clive Barker, and the oozing, shuddery pathologies of a David Cronenberg movie. Zombies, spies, conspiracies, and gallons of goo make this the fastest read in the west! Highest recommendation!""
-- Jay Bonansinga, national bestselling author of Shattered, Twisted, Frozen, and The Sinking of the Eastland

""Sigler has a unique talent for keeping readers on the edge of their seats; I absolutely had to know what was going to happen next. Infected is full of mayhem, action, and gore--and you won't be able to put it down.""
-- Dave Wellington, author of 13 Bullets and the Monster Island trilogy

""Scott Sigler's Infected is a bucking pulp pony that throws you this way and that, and just when you think you've got your balance, that ole pony bucks the other way. All in all, one hell of an exhilarating ride, and highly recommended.""
--Joe R. Lansdale, World Horror Convention Grand Maste"

Philosophy,"Marcus Aurelius was a Roman Emperor and philosopher who wrote Meditations; insights which were considered to give the meaning of life.  The book was not written with the intent to be published.  It offers a noteworthy chain of challenging situations which are a reflection on spirituality and enumerate the struggle to understand oneself and one's role in the universe.  Written in the style of a journal, Meditations emphasizes that life in this world is short.

Aurelius was a stoic philosopher who had influenced the thoughts of many leaders in his time.  The first of several overarching themes in Meditations is to evaluate self judgment and judgment of others.  Another theme is that everything comes from nature and will return to nature once again.  A final theme is to maintain focus and be attentive.

The author establishes the point that we should enjoy the things that are possible and within our reach and at the same time recognize that other thins our outside of our control and should not concern us.

Aurelius uses statements to emphasize faith in God and how to lead a good life in the face of temptation.  This book provides support and personal comfort and is a captivating read."

News & Politics,"It was a crime that rocked an idyllic seaside town in Cape Cod -- the 2002 murder of Christa Worthington, who was found stabbed to death with her 2-year-old daughter, unharmed at her side. What came next was a three-year search for her killer that would involve unorthodox steps by police, a lengthy list of potential suspects, and an entire town under suspicion. Christa's trash collector, Christopher McCowen, would eventually be convicted of the crime, but his trial would raise questions about the evidence, investigative methods, and whether racial prejudice played a role. Now, ABC Radio and ""20/20"" take a look at all the evidence and for the first time ever, hear directly from Christopher McCowen, to examine whether the right man is behind bars.

Outdoor,"A lighthearted conversation by trail, road, and ultra runners about their lives as runners and the issues that are interesting or important to them and guests of the show.  TJM is meant to be a companion to you as you run.  Think of us as your running partners on days when you just need some friends to get you out on an easy run.  The show is composed of 10 segments, one for each mile, and every 10 minutes or so we move on to the next topic, to keep things interesting.  Among the hosts' experience are ten 100-mile finishes, dozens of half and full marathons, plenty of 50-milers, and some speedy 5ks and a BQ (and a handful of DNFs).
Scott Kummer is an attorney, doberman owner and quite possibly the most painstakingly average runner known to man.  Scott has stumbled through numerous plus 4 and 5 hour marathons.  He's DNF'ed the 150 mile, 100 mile, 50 mile and marathon distance.  He was once kicked out of an ultra runing group due to allegations of cyber-bullying.  He has a habit of offending people by accident while trying to help them.  He is a co-founder of the Flatlander Ultrarunners in Chicagoland which has rapidly grown to over 600 members.  He came up with the idea for Ten Junk Miles after becoming frustrated with hearing interview after interview of Scott Jurek and deciding that runners needed more: more discussions of bathroom breaks that went wrong, pacer stories from hell, DNF reports, stories of getting lost on the trail and other related matters.
Tony Silvestri, father, husband, ultra runner, took up podcast production on a whim in 2015 to help out the show. Simply put, if Al Gore hadn't invented the internet, Tony would have. He can grill a pizza on an open flame. He can create (and end) long lasting friendships faster than you can say ""turn over a new leaf."" He's still waiting for that first 100. Sometimes he talks wayyyyy too much on the show but we overlook that, because it is a little known fact that he once stopped a coyote from attacking the gang with a cold dad stare.
Amy Briggs was born with a piano attached to her fingers.  Given no choice, she took up the Tuba.  Not really.  She teaches piano at one of the top 5 Universities in the country and has played with with the Chicago Symphony, one of the best in the world.  When she is not focused on being at the top of her rather unusual field she hits the trails and Chicago Lakefront Path, training her ass off for her first 100 miler at Kettle Morraine in 2016 to accentuate her already stellar performances at the Marathon, 50K and 50 Mile distance.
Aaron German is a speedster, plain and simple.  He's the only one in the group that has ever cracked the three hour marathon barrier and the only one brave enough to wear mandex in public. He's a Kansas City native and University of Chicago grad that found out by accident that losing tons of weight can make you run faster.  Aaron trades stocks and fantasy baseball players while juggling the lack of commitments that comes with having no wife, no kids and no real job.  In short, Aaron has nothing better to do than run long and fast and think about funny things to say.

Higher Education,"We live in a world filled with material wealth, live longer and healthier lives, and yet anxiety, stress, unhappiness, and depression have never been more common. What are the driving forces behind these interlinked global epidemics?

In this series, Professor Mark Williams (Wellcome Trust Principal Research Fellow at Oxford University) and Dr Danny Penman discuss the recent scientific advances that have radically altered our understanding of depression and related disorders. Also discussed is the latest treatments and therapies that are offering hope to those suffering from depression.

Professor Williams co-developed Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy (MBCT), a treatment for anxiety, stress and depression that is at least as effective as drugs at preventing new episodes of depression. It's now one of the preferred treatments for depression recommended by the UK's National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence. The same technique, based upon an ancient form of meditation, can also help us cope more effectively with the relentless demands of our increasingly frantic world. Professor Williams and Dr Penman co-authored the bestselling book Mindfulness: Finding Peace in a Frantic World."

What if  it's all true?

Personal Journals,"There are 24 hours in a day. Seems pretty straightforward. But what do you really know about the hours between say, 11pm-6am. From graveyard shift jobs to ‚Äúsecret identities‚Äù, who we are and what we do at night is often less fully perceived by others, whether by choice or by circumstance. Peering into the dusty corners of the night, Nocturne explores these often overlooked and undisclosed slices of life. Under cover of darkness, our thoughts and feelings can take on strange new shapes, sometimes barely recognizable as our own. And the pulse of the world seems to alter too, sort of creating a curtain of privacy around our behaviors and even our appearance. Do I truly know you if I only know the daytime you? Let‚Äôs find out in Nocturne. Nocturne is a member of The Heard, an awesome collective of sound-rich, story-driven podcasts.



Nocturne is essay radio - a hybrid form of audio storytelling that blends elements of documentary, fiction and sound-art.



The Nocturne podcast was created by Vanessa Lowe and Kent Sparling, and is produced by Vanessa Lowe. Theme music composed by Kent Sparling."

Non-Profit,"We believe that Freemasonry provides a genuine initiatory experience and a pathway to mature masculinity. The Gentle Craft brings together men who might have otherwise been divided by class, race, religion, or sectarian opinion and allows them to become friends and Brothers. It provides important moral instruction and non-dogmatic support for faith in the Divine. It gives men a sense of their place in society, in history, and in the universe. Freemasonry is not only relevant for men in our modern age, but essential.  


** We believe candidates should be provided the best possible experience in joining the Fraternity. The experience of being Entered, Passed and Raised should be deeply moving, impressive, and memorable. But these experiences are essential but insufficient for a truly good candidate experience. The traditional education for candidates consisting of memorization of catechisms or lectures provides an excellent opportunity to introduce candidates to the philosophy, history, and traditions of the Fraternity. Mere memorization isn‚Äôt education. It is imperative that candidates be provided with the opportunity to begin to develop a real understanding of the degrees and the Craft.  

* We believe in the tradition of making ‚Äúdaily progress in Freemasonry.‚Äù Freemasonry is a progressive science ‚Äî that is to say, it is a body of knowledge that requires study and effort. Only through such study does a man progress in his understanding of the Mysteries of Masonry and begin to improve himself and, thereby, his community. It is our hope that as we build more resources on our website we can become a resource for those in the Craft seeking to make daily progress.
