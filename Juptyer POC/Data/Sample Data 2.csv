The title Infants on Thrones is an homage to the Mormon Founder Joseph Smith who said, in his lesser-known King Follet discourse, that eternity is full of thrones, upon which dwell thousands of children, reigning on thrones of glory, with not one cubit added to their stature. It is a funny image, but it also suggests that we, as amateur podcasters, do not really have all the answers we may think we do. We can't take ourselves too seriously. We are also Infants on Thrones."

National,"From TED: The American political system has been foundationally weakened by a corrupt campaign funding system, creating a dangerously unstable and inequitable design that could destroy our republic ‚Äî if we let it. In Le$terland: The Corruption of Congress and How To End It, Harvard law professor Lawrence Lessig assesses the deep flaws in our campaign finance system and lays out a plan for fixing it. Lessig describes a place called ‚ÄúLesterland,‚Äù a fictional land with a population of 311 million people of whom the 144,000, named Lester are the people really in charge. It‚Äôs the United States, of course, and Lesters are the 0.05 percent of Americans who fund the election. Lessig notes that just 132 Americans gave 60 percent of the SuperPAC money spent in the election cycle. It‚Äôs these few, he says, who are our Lesters, and our dependence on them is perverting the democracy of the country. After all, if candidates have to spend 30 to 70 percent of their time trying to raise funds to get back to Congress, which they do, might that not affect their principles, their beliefs, their ideals, and what they‚Äôre prepared to fight for on behalf of the people?

Performing,"Gunsmoke was a long-running old-time radio and television Western drama program set in Dodge City, Kansas during the settlement of the American West. The radio show first aired on April 26, 1952 and ran until June 18, 1961 on the CBS radio network. The series starred William Conrad as Marshal Matt Dillon, Howard McNear as Doc Charles Adams, Georgia Ellis as Kitty Russell, and Parley Baer as Deputy Chester Proudfoot. Doc‚Äôs first name and Chester‚Äôs last name were changed for the television program. Gunsmoke was notable for its critically acclaimed cast and writing, and is commonly regarded as one of the finest old time radio shows. Some listeners have argued that the radio version of Gunsmoke was far more realistic than the television program. Episodes were aimed at adults, and featured some of the most explicit content of the day: there were violent crimes and scalpings, massacres and opium addicts. Miss Kitty‚Äôs occupation as a prostitute was made far more obvious on the radio version than on television. Many episodes ended on a down-note, and villains often got away with their crimes."

Literature,"Austen‚Äôs timeless romantic classic, follows the lives of the five Bennett sisters, who live in a time where an advantageous marriage and social status are considered a fundamental for any woman to stand a fair chance at life. Set at the turn of the 19th century, Pride and Prejudice catches a perfect glimpse not only of a time when women were socially and economically dependent solely on their marital status, but also as an age of enlightenment and witness of the French Revolution.

This romantic novel with its hint of comic references begins with the famous quote ""It is a truth universally acknowledged that a single man in possession of a good fortune must be in want of a wife.""
This famous quotation sets the story into motion as the eligible Mr. Bingley is introduced as he rides into town. The quote also draws in and to some extent reveals the content of the plot to come. Soon the news of the arrival of the well off Charles Bingley finds its way to the ears of the Bennett household. Having five unmarried daughters, the Bennetts are eager to match them up with suitable spouse candidates and see them prosperously married. After attending a ball, Mr. Bingley is instantly attracted to the oldest Bennett daughter Jane and it is fair to say that the feeling is mutual. Such cannot be said about his close friend Mr. Darcy who rudely refuses to dance with the second Bennett daughter Elizabeth. Consequently, Elizabeth‚Äôs first prejudice is born as she labels Mr. Darcy arrogant and obnoxious; however, she later learns never to judge a book by its cover and must swallow up her pride to achieve happiness. Pride and Prejudice witnesses the exciting courtships of the Bennett sisters and their suitors, as well as the not so joyful relationships of other characters. As the novel develops the relationships between the characters must outweigh the forces seeking to tear them apart. 

Experience the adventures of the Bennett sisters as they face the troublesome issues of manners, social class, family, and marriages in a male reliant society. A story not only portraying the unreliable nature of pride and prejudice, Austen‚Äôs classic also paints a vivid image of the past and the woman as a member of society."

Performing,"It's an alternate 2016, and Watchtower 10 sits in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean, keeping lonely watch over the Transcontinental Bridge. Each watchtower sits hundreds of feet away from the Bridge, broadcasting regular traffic reports to ensure that proper safety precautions are taken. These lighthouses (for cars) are filled with a carefully selected (and very capable) crew.

Watchtower 10's necessary personnel happen to be: a generalist DJ who spends her free time relaying folklore from abandoned parts of the Bridge, her supervisor (who's only there because he lost a bet), an unfailingly optimistic Bridge Travel Agent, and a groundskeeper who has a thing for romantic comedies. 

Unbeknownst to the general public (but totally knownst to each watchtower's crew), these stations also hold a secret that could potentially destroy the world...or save it.

The Bridge is a fictional serialized fantasy podcast about the monsters we fear, the monsters we can become, and the stories we leave behind."
Language Courses,"A wandering king who's a war-hero doomed to roam the earth by a vengeful God, a plethora of fantastic experiences, a wife battling the invasion of suitors who wish to replace her missing husband, a son in search of his father - the Odyssey is a rich tapestry of incredible experiences and unforgettable characters. A must-read classic for anyone who wants to understand the fundamentals of Western mythology, it is a sequel to the Illiad which recounts the magnificent saga of the Trojan War. The Odyssey continues on, describing the trials and tribulations of the Greeks under the leadership of Odysseus. 

Reputed to have been composed nearly three thousand years ago, its authorship is still being debated by scholars, though much of it is attributed to the blind poet Homer about whom very little is known. Yet the Illiad and The Odyssey remain the definitive foundations of all Western literature. The Odyssey is a magnificent epic tale that portrays the journey called life. In fact the word ‚Äúodyssey‚Äù in English itself has come to mean a long and eventful journey. 

In the preceding book The Illiad, Odysseus called Ulysses in Roman mythology, the king of Ithaca, gets embroiled in the Trojan War through the trickery of the Greeks. But once inside, his wonderful qualities of intellect, strategy and leadership come to the foreground as he leads his soldiers to victory. The story of the Odyssey begins when the war of The Illiad ends. Odysseus and his men embark to return to Ithaca but his sworn enemy, the sea god Poseidon, stymies him at every turn, sending storms and foul weather, forcing the wanderers to take shelter in strange and sinister lands. 

The Odyssey is, besides, the story of Odysseus' beautiful wife Penelope, whose life becomes a struggle, fighting off the innumerable hopefuls who wish to take over her kingdom and her fortune in the absence of her husband. It is also the poignant growing-up tale of Telemachus, a faithful and steadfast son, who refuses to believe that his father won't return. 

There are many notable translations from the original Greek and it has also been extensively portrayed in art, literature, television and television in languages around the world. Full of human tragedy, bizarre and fantastic creatures, gods and magical beasts, the Odyssey is a treasure-chest of marvelous events. For modern-day readers, young and old alike, it provides exciting, interesting and relevant ideas of war, politics, exile and identity."

Social Sciences,"‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know that I have a theory of integration; I know I have a life of it,‚Äù said Stanley Hauerwas, renowned Christian ethicist and featured lecturer for the annual Fuller Symposium on the Integration of Psychology and Theology, on Wednesday, February 16. During the two-day symposium, Dr. Hauerwas delivered three lectures reflecting on the topic ‚ÄúGod and Mental Illness,‚Äù drawing from his own experience with Ann, his wife of 24 years who was diagnosed with bipolar disorder. The symposium was established to discover new connections between the disciplines of faith and psychology, commented School of Psychology Dean Winston Gooden in his opening remarks, and ‚Äúone area that has been most neglected is theological reflection on mental illness.‚Äù

Stanley Hauerwas is the Gilbert T. Rowe Professor of Theological Ethics at the Divinity School of Duke University and holds a joint appointment at Duke Law School.

Literature,"Two years after his wife's death, oceanographer and former navy SEAL, Atticus Young, attempts to reconcile with his rebellious daughter, Giona, by taking her on the scuba dive of a lifetime-swimming with a pod of peaceful humpback whales in the Gulf of Maine.  But the beauty of the sea belies a terror from the deep-a horrific creature as immense as it is ancient. There is no blood, no scream, no fight. Giona is swallowed whole by the massive jaws. Only Atticus remains to suffer the shame of the survivor and his inconsolable grief turns to an unquenchable thirst for revenge.

Drawn by the spectacle, Trevor Manfred, a ruthless billionaire, approaches Atticus with a proposition: Trevor will make available all the advanced technology of his heavily armed mega-yacht, the Titan, to aid Atticus in his death-quest. In return, Trevor is to receive the beast's corpse as the ultimate hunting trophy.  But in the midst of the hunt, Atticus makes a terrifying discovery that changes the way he sees the ocean's creatures and begs the question: what is Kronos? The answer sets him on a new and much more deadly course.

In line with the well-established scientific tradition of the Institute, this research is characterized by (a) its trans-disciplinary nature, (b) its use of nonlinear dynamical systems to study the explicit out-of-equilibrium dynamics of the relevant processes, (c) and sustained interaction between mathematical modeling and well-defined empirical case studies and problems of potentially great contemporary practical relevance.

History,"The series follows the Mormon faith through the lens of ‚ÄúThe Principle of Plural Marriage‚Äù from its genesis in 1831 with its originator Joseph Smith, through the hidden history and governmental pressure, to today and contemporary practicing Fundamentalist Mormons. 



For the first time polygamy is dissected through a feminist viewpoint, with attention given to the experiences of the women, women who sacrificed everything and suffered long and are never mentioned in museums or landmark tours. Their experiences, along with interviews with experts, sc20140302_130747holars, historians, and those still affected directly by the practice, paint a new portrait of how the west was shaped, by the hard work and toil of these invisible women, hidden away through controversy. 



Through Hansen‚Äôs careful work, we see how the practice of polygamy affected every aspect of the LDS church‚Äôs formation and is still a shadow hanging over the church, visible in it‚Äôs approach to marriage, the role of women, and the temple ceremonies. Instead of the historical footnote polygamy is often treated as, Hansen shows how this practice, started in secret and a direct cause of Joseph Smith‚Äôs death, responsible for driving the saints to Utah, and then outward again to Mexico and Canada, the root of power struggles both in the church and out, the cause of suspicion and eventually violence including the Mountain Meadows Massacre, was an instigator to most of the history of American West. For the first time, The Year of Polygamy shows how the west was settled not only to claim land and mineral rights, but in a very real way to control the bodies and sexuality of women in a way that reverberates today.

News & Politics,"Welcome to Crimetown, a series produced by Marc Smerling and Zac Stuart-Pontier in partnership with Gimlet Media. Each season, we investigate the culture of crime in a different city. 

In Season 2, Crimetown heads to the heart of the Rust Belt: Detroit, Michigan. From its heyday as Motor City to its rebirth as the Brooklyn of the Midwest, Detroit‚Äôs history reflects a series of issues that strike at the heart of American identity: race, poverty, policing, loss of industry, the war on drugs, and our universal desire for a savior. Detroit‚Äôs a tough town, and its residents are even tougher. They‚Äôve weathered riots, a drug epidemic, political scandal, and innumerable other hardships, but they‚Äôre still here‚Äîand they have stories to tell. 

New episodes out Mondays, exclusively on Spotify. To listen on Spotify for free, go to spotify.com/crimetown."

Literature,"AUTHOR'S NOTE: This is ""The Beta Version"" of this podiobook. 7th Son: Descent is now available as a print novel from St. Martin's Press. During the editorial process, significant changes and improvements were made to Descent's print manuscript. Character names were changed, and events at the end of the print novel were modified in ways that will impact the rest of the print trilogy. The print novel represents an official reboot of the 7th Son series.

Due to these changes, this ""Beta Version"" of Book Two: Deceit is no longer the ""official"" version of the podiobook. Please visit the 7th Son: Descent (The Print Edition) page to subscribe to the definitive beginning of the trilogy. You're welcome to continue the series with this version of Deceit, but understand that you will encounter slight inconsistencies in character names and plot references.

THE STORY
Two days ago, seven human clones -- John, Michael, Father Thomas, Dr. Mike, Jonathan, Jack and Kilroy2.0 -- were torn away from their ""normal"" lives to stop a ruthless plot created by their progenitor, a man code-named John Alpha. Their quest was a descent into conspiracy, violence and death.

The clones were successful in their mission, but victory was not without its price.

As 7th Son: Book Two - Deceit begins, the Beta clones are demoralized, reeling from their loss ... and about to learn that John Alpha's plans are far from over.

To prevent the next phase of Alpha's plan, John, Kilroy2.0, and the others must unearth more dark secrets about the government project from which they were spawned. They will experience the horrors of betrayal, and race cross-country to track John Alpha.

And they will finally realize the scope of Alpha's wrath -- the bloodshed the clones have witnessed is merely a prelude to the world-rending destruction to come. Unless they can stop it first.

Deceit is the second novel in J.C. Hutchins' 7th Son thriller trilogy."

Self-Help,"The Bubble Hour is hosted by Jean M., a sober woman dedicated to breaking down the walls of stigma and denial surrounding the disease of alcoholism.

Alcoholism effects more than 50% of American adults, either directly or indirectly, and yet it still remains a ""taboo"" topic and is still mostly misunderstood by the majority of people (even those effected by alcoholism and their loved ones).

The Bubble Hour seeks to inform, educate and help people identify with the stories they hear, the conversations and interviews with people who are just like they are, and let people know they aren't alone. Nobody can take the first tentative steps towards sobriety without first getting past denial, but even once they are past denial the stigma surrounding alcoholism is so strong that people are reluctant to seek help.

The Bubble Hour would like to change that stigma. Jean and the vibrant community of sober people who join her here, will be recording and offering this show for anyone to listen to for information, community, empathy and understanding.

We are so grateful for the sober people who came before us to help find this path; this is one way to give back.

Please help us spread the word about this website and the pod casts; you may be helping someone you know well but don't even know they have a problem.

Alcoholism thrives in the dark.  Together, we bring light.  And hope."

Literature,"Some places are far darker than deep space.  Places where the shadows smile.   Where men go mad and lovers go missing.  These stygian corners of existence are where reality is stretched thin and something hungry is waiting just outside the corner of your eye.Turn out the lights, take a deep breath, and dare to visit one of these places.Crescent is dark science fiction at it's most visceral.  Phil Rossi weaves a tale that is reminiscent of old school Stephen King but with a shiny, new set of tricks and an appetite to terrify.   There's sex. There's corruption. There's horror.  And after you sweat your way through the first chapter, there's plenty more to keep you awake at night.Crescent features an original soundtrack written and performed by the author. ""... what is right now, my addiction -- Crescent. I'm waiting to see what happens with the freakin' story.  *I* do this to people, other people don't do this to me!"" -- Scott Sigler, author of Infested (Infection), Earthcore, and Ancestor.""If you're debating about subscribing to Crescent, I've got one question: Why are you hesitating?  Just push the button that says ""Subscribe"" and hold on.  This podcast is part Babylon 5, part Firefly, and part Blade Runner... only darker.""  -- Tee Morris, Author of Morevi, Billibub Baddings and the Case of the Singing Sword, and co-author of Podcasting for Dummies.""The writing is great, the reading is first class; the production - the use of atmospheric music and ambient sound like crowd noise is really effective."" -- Mike Bennett, author of One Among the Sleepless."

He knew nothing about entrepreneurship, nothing about startups, nothing about marketing, and nothing about online or how to build a business. So from launching Foundr Magazine he's gone out and spoken to some of the most successful entrepreneurs and founders in the world to find out exactly what it takes to become a successful entrepreneur, so YOU can learn from them.

Why this podcast? Because we're asking the same questions you want to know as an entrepreneur on their journey to building an extremely successful business. We're on the front-lines facing the daily battles you are. How do I get more customers? How do I scale my business? I want to start a business, but just don't know where to start? How did this person get millions of customers and make millions of dollars and have a such a massive impact on the world?

Some of these entrepreneurs are very well known, and some not known at all and that‚Äôs the cool part! Here we will share with you our best interviews from Foundr magazine showcasing this persons processes, failures, critical lessons learnt and actionable strategies showing YOU how to build a successful business. This is NOT your AVERAGE everyday entrepreneurship podcast."

Hello and welcome history friends patrons all to When Diplomacy Fails Podcast, or WDF as I like to call it! My name is Zack Twamley, history masters graduate, author and all-round history nerd! For over six years, I have been privileged to examine wars throughout history through a unique lens. I always try to ask what on the surface may seem like very reasonable questions - why, how and WHEN did diplomacy fail? This approach has enabled a loyal base of 'history friends' to grow up around WDF, and thanks to their much appreciated work getting the word out there, we have taken history podcasting to incredible new heights!
 
You should know that my jam at WDF is not the mundane, the tedious or the repetitive - I care little for the logistics of why one general moves his forces to point A, or what impact weapon X had on the war. Instead, I delve into human agency, the story populated by sometimes ingenious, sometimes fatally flawed human beings, who believed or had been led to believe that the time was right for war. Under these circumstances, diplomacy certainly fails, but thanks to our window into the era, you get to find out all about it! From the machinations of Louis XIV, to the complex set of events which led to the outbreak of the First World War, to the most obscure of conflicts besides, WDF has been through it all, and there's so much more to come! So why not stop by, give us a listen, and do your bit to help make history THRIVE!

If you want to lend a hand to what I do here then please subscribe/rate/review the podcast here, like the Facebook page, follow on Twitter @wdfpodcast visit the website www.wdfpodcast.com become a Patron at www.patreon.com/WhenDiplomacyFails and contact Zack directly at his email address: wdfpodcast@hotmail.com  Thanksss!"

Society & Culture,"From June, 1962 through January, 1964, women in the city of Boston lived in fear of the infamous Strangler. Over those 19 months, he committed 13 known murders-crimes that included vicious sexual assaults and bizarre stagings of the victims' bodies. After the largest police investigation in Massachusetts history, handyman Albert DeSalvo confessed and went to prison. Despite DeSalvo's full confession and imprisonment, authorities would never put him on trial for the actual murders. And more than 50 years later, significant doubts continue to surround the case. Was DeSalvo really the killer? Was there more than one Strangler? And did the Boston PD and the FBI do everything necessary to find and stop the murderer?
¬†
Stranglers, an original 12-part weekly documentary podcast from Stitcher and Northern Light Productions, is a fascinating, contemporary audio investigation of the Boston Strangler story. Using never-before-heard voices, interviews with actual suspects, extensive original research and new conversations with the victims' family members, host Portland Helmich will introduce you to every facet of the case, from the reporters who originally covered it to the police who worked furiously to solve it, as well as terrified witnesses who claim to have met the Strangler himself."

Personal Journals,"Two years, two months and two days! This is what forms the time line of one man's quest for the simple life and a unique social experiment in complete self reliance and independence. Henry David Thoreau published Walden in 1884. Originally drafted as a series of essays describing a most significant episode in his life, it was finally released in book form with each essay taking on the form of a separate chapter. 

Thoreau's parents were in financial straights, but rich intellectually and culturally. The young Henry was educated in the best of schools in their home town, Concord, Massachusetts and went on to graduate from Harvard, where he read history, philosophy, theology and literature. He commenced working as a school master in Concord but soon quit when he discovered that he was not ideologically suited to methods employed in those days which included corporal punishment. During this time, a chance meeting with the great philosopher, Ralph Waldo Emerson marked a turning point in his life. 

Deeply influenced by Emerson's ideas and his Transcendentalism cult, Thoreau embarked on the Walden experiment. The Transcendentalism movement was an amalgam of Buddhism, German and English Romanticism, Hindu teachings, Confucianism and placed great emphasis on emotional wellbeing, self reliance and personal truths rather than social norms. It rejected society's dominance over the individual. 

Walden Pond was located in a property owned by Emerson. Here, Thoreau built a cabin and proceeded to live a completely self sufficient life, gathering his own food and preparing it, sleeping and reading and appreciating nature as the whim took him. He meticulously recorded every experience and this forms the body of work known as Walden.  

The book received a lukewarm reception when it first appeared, but went on to gather cult status with the advent of the Flower Power generation, the anti-establishment movements against the Vietnam War and the Civil Rights movement. The concepts of individual freedom and individual choice became ingrained in the American psyche as a new generation of Americans re-discovered Walden.  

Walden's main appeal lies in its exploration of themes like solitude, economy, the simple life and the Higher Laws that he describes which relate to man's relationship to nature. Thoreau's style is attractive and easy, full of nuggets of folksy wisdom. Modern proponents of simplifying life, those who oppose our over reliance on technology and advocates of inner spiritual awakening are sure to find Walden a valuable and rewarding read."

Society & Culture,"Those Conspiracy Guys is an Irish comedy podcast where we discuss all types and genres of conspiracy theories, paranormal happenings and true crime from Atlantean myths to Zapruder films; from ghosts and demons to alien abductions; from werewolves and vampires to CIA assassins and Russian spies. We have a big episode every two weeks, a True Crime show every other week and loads of other stuff every so often and you can head over to the website for details.

Our aim is to cast a light into the dark corners of corruption, conspiracy and suppression. We want to scour a web laden with tales of political intrigue, extra-terrestrials, rogue governments, secret societies, the paranormal, murder, mayhem, deceit, destruction, the cryptozoological and the psycho-pharmacological and present the fable of the 21st century: The Conspiracy Theory.

It's a Podcast that asks the unanswered questions of the wildest mysteries and weirdest truths from throughout our history. Taking universally available information from all around the internet and beyond, we'll provide a funny and friendly resource for all your conspiracy needs.

With weekly Podcast episodes and our constantly updated website Those Conspiracy Guys want to bring some truth to your inquisitive ears.

No topic is too delicate or outlandish and we want to make it palatable for everyone from beginners to experts. From the average guy on the street to a die hard conspiracy nut, we want to bring you the great conspiracies of time immemorial to the ones unfolding around us everyday. We avoid the tinfoil hats and poorly crafted sci-fi stories that litter the internet, to bring you conspiracies that you have heard about and more that you haven‚Äôt. 

We are gleaning information from a seemingly insurmountable wall of waffle and running our common sense detector over some of the misinformation that lies in the stagnant swamp of the web.

We are but 'humble' Irish people, with a propensity for critical thinking and common sense, and a host of friends with the same mindset, but we all have a third eye squinted open for the strangeness of truth and are all tireless in the never ending quest for the opportunity to have the craic.

Have you ever watched the news and thought ‚Äòthat doesn‚Äôt look right?‚Äô.

Have you ever questioned main stream media or questioned what ‚Äòmain stream‚Äô even means?

Have you ever agonised over the official version of events that seemed like they were the script of a bad movie?

Then this is the podcast for you. We analyse easily available material and cast a critical eye over it; discussing the validity of its sources and its credibility as fact. Sometimes we believe it, sometimes we don‚Äôt, but you can make your own mind up because we are just a bunch of people with some free time and questionable search histories. 

You can support our show by visiting www.patreon.com/thoseconspiracyguys and donating. You will get access to awesome exclusive content and be able to interact with us like you're the favourite in the family!"

Sexuality,"Keeper of Your Darkest Secrets



When we confess intimate secrets, we reveal vulnerabilities about ourselves, hoping that our confessions will create a connection with someone who will understand or with someone who may fulfill our secret desires.  Not only do we all have secrets, but we also have secret selves.   The relative anonymity of phone sex allows our secret selves to come out and play--to safely confess or reveal secrets that we would not feel comfortable revealing anyplace else.  Phone sex provides immediate connectivity and communication. But I don‚Äôt consider myself to be a typical phone sex operator in any respect. Instead, I am the Keeper of Your Darkest Secrets.  

  

In ancient times, and in different cultures, the role of the keeper of secrets was often held by courtesans, geishas, mistresses: women whom men sought out for sexual intimacies--yet so much more.  Keeping our own secrets is often a burden, a weight, and revealing secrets is a liberating and indeed, often an arousing experience.    



When you listen to my podcasts and audios, you can relax, take pleasure in my seductive voice and consider all of the amazing possibilities that I have to offer you.  And if you are looking for something personalized, I can also record custom erotic audio, custom erotic mp3‚Äôs, erotic hypnosis audio files or whatever your pleasure. 



Do you long to experience this intimacy with a beautiful, mature, educated woman?  We can create our own personal, sacred space to connect through intelligent phone sex.  For example, we can pursue therapist fantasy phone sex where I can assume the role of your therapist, the modern keeper of secrets (though in reality ethically asexual). 



Whether in the form of my podcasts, my pre-recorded or custom audios, or phone sex, I am the sensual, discreet Keeper of Your Darkest Secrets. I wouldn't have it any other way."

History,"The Art of War is a 6th Century BC Chinese treatise on war and military strategy known for its timeless examples of strategy and planning. There is intense interest in this ancient work since it teaches how to be victorious in conflict and that the final victory ultimately is to see war as an effort to win minds and hearts rather than a mere acquisition of territory and wealth. 

The Art of War by Sun Tzu is a two thousand year old work, reputedly authored by a famous military general and strategist who lived in ancient China. Apart from this, he is also revered and respected in many South Asian countries as a learned philosopher. The book is divided into thirteen chapters and there is historical evidence to prove that it was written over a period of time and perhaps with many borrowings and collaborations with other similar works of the period. However, it was also heavily criticized by generations of scholars and thinkers in later centuries as it advocated deception and spying as accepted strategies in war. Many scholars have also doubted whether a figure such as Sun Tzu existed at all and have found several inaccuracies in terms of the timeframe in which the book was supposed to have been written. Many feel that the original work may have undergone several revisions over the centuries before being consolidated in its present form. Whatever the nature of these opinions The Art of War remains a fascinating, valuable and extremely interesting work.

Each chapter explores a different aspect of war. Beginning with elaborate plans that should be put in place before the commencement of war, the book goes on to describe different situations in which wars are fought, the kind of strategies employed in various types of terrain, understanding the nature of the enemy and finally positioning, timing and methods of attack. 

For present day corporate warriors, The Art of War is an invaluable text. Business management, sports and politics are some of the fields where it has found immense application. Conflict resolution theory has been immeasurably enhanced with the addition of Sun Tzu's millennia-old tried and tested methods. It also provides valuable assistance in the grooming of leaders, understanding and appreciating the opponent and leveraging one's own advantages.

The Art of War provides compelling reading for anyone who is interested in the dynamics of negotiation, competition, mediation, planning and arbitration."

And we got you covered in television with Black Mirror, Supergirl, Stranger Things, Daredevil, Into The Badlands, Westworld, Preacher, Game of Thrones and The Walking Dead.  So strap yourself in and have a good time!   Strap yourself in?  Really?  Just listen.  No straps required.  Unless you're into that sort of thing.

Fitness & Nutrition,"Losing Weight is as easy as 1,2,3,4 

In order to lose weight you have to do four things. Most people focus only on one or two things, that's why they fail. Most people focus on either 1) eating right or 2) exercising more.

While those two things are the nuts and bolts to losing weight. There are two other elements that are just as important and without implementing them you are destined to fail. In order to successfully lose weight and keep it off you also must have 3) a support sytem and 4) an accountability system in place.

We discovered the importance of support and accountability during the time we owned a personal training studio. Our clients were able to stay compliant with their eating and exercise programs as long as a trainer was there to support them and keep them accountable. If a client ever left, they inevitably had a difficult time staying compliant and eventually gained the weight they had struggled so desperately to lose right back.

In order to make personal training (which is typically very expensive) more accessible to everyone we developed the Partner Power Weight Loss Program. Partner Power teaches you some of the pyschological dynamics that help trainers support their clients and keep them accountable. Obviously a partner is not a fitness trainer, but they can serve some if not most of the roles a trainer serves in the areas of support and accountability.

Through our live weekly radio show Dr. Fitness and the Fat Guy which airs every Thursday in Atlanta, Georgia USA at 7PM EST (this podcast is an on-demand replay of our weekly weight loss radio show in its entirety) as well as our blog and our website we will be teaching our Partner Power weight loss philosophy in order to educate, motivate and support anyone who is interested in losing weight."

During the editorial process, significant changes and improvements were made to Descent's print manuscript. Character names were changed, and events at the end of the print novel were modified in ways that will impact the rest of the print trilogy. The print novel represents an official reboot of the 7th Son series.

Due to these changes, this ""Beta Version"" of Book One: Descent is no longer the ""official"" version of the podiobook. Please visit the 7th Son: Descent (The Print Edition) page to subscribe to the definitive version of the story.

THE STORY
Three weeks ago, the U.S. president was murdered by a four-year-old boy.

Today, seven men stare at each other in a locked conference room. Kidnapped and brought to this underground facility, the strangers are sitting in silence, thunderstruck. Despite minor physical differences, they all appear to be the same man, with the same name ... and the same childhood memories.

Unwitting participants in a secret human cloning experiment, these seven ""John Michael Smiths"" have been gathered by their creators for one reason -- to capture the mastermind behind the president's assassination.

Their target? The man they were cloned from; the original John Michael Smith, code-named John Alpha.

Soon our heroes -- John, Jack, Michael, Kilroy2.0 and the others -- realize the president's murder was merely a prologue to Alpha's plans. As the mystery deepens and the implications of Alpha's scheme are slowly revealed, the clones decide to stand against John Alpha. The outcome will unearth a conspiracy larger than they could have ever imagined.

Descent is the first novel in J.C. Hutchins' 7th Son thriller trilogy."

TV & Film,"The Weekly Lost Podcast is where Cliff and Stephanie‚Äôs journey into the world of podcasting began back in 2005. While Stephanie had been watching LOST from the very first episode, Cliff had got hooked on the show after catching the last four episodes of the first season. For Cliff, it was the hidden clues and the overall mystery of the island that drew him in.
Cliff had initially started out blogging about Lost and listening to a small handful of Lost Podcasts. Many of Cliff‚Äôs blog posts highlighting easter eggs and unique theories were picked up by major media outlets like Entertainment Weekly. When Cliff was encouraged by Lost Podcasters, Ryan & Jenn Ozawa, to launch his own podcast, he jumped at the opportunity and convinced Stephanie to join him.
The rest is history which you can read on the GSPN Wikipedia page. While the show was on the air, Cliff and Stephanie produced two podcast episodes every week devoted to the show. They would record an initial reaction podcast immediately following the episode and then they would produce a full weekend review in a live audience setting on the gspn.tv live show page.
Now that the series has come to an end, the show is no longer produced on a ‚Äúweekly‚Äù basis. However, more episodes of this podcast will be produced as they feel prompted to do so and as they have the opportunity to interview more members of the cast and crew from the show."

Once popular and now little-known, they can tell us a lot about what their first audiences enjoyed, aspired to and worried about - from immigrants in early modern London to the role of women in the household, from what religious changes might mean for attitudes to the dead to fantasies of easy money and social elevation.

Each lecture outlines the play so there is no assumption you have already read it, then goes on to try to understand its historical context and its dramatic legacy, drawing parallels with modern film and contemporary culture as well as with Elizabethan material. The lecturer's aim with students in the room and with interested listeners on iTunes U is to broaden our understanding of the theatre Shakespeare wrote for by thinking about some non-Shakespearean drama, and to recreate some of the excitement and dramatic possibilities of the new, popular technology of Renaissance theatre."

Philosophy,"Beyond Good and Evil, by Friedrich Nietzsche

A searing indictment of concepts like ‚Äútruth‚Äù and ‚Äúlanguage‚Äù Beyond Good and Evil, by Friedrich Nietzsche is a deeply thought provoking book that forms one of the keystones of modern thought and politics. 

In this book, Nietzsche takes the position that our subservience to fixed perspectives that are forced on us by our language and our ideals make us incapable of perceiving reality. He propounds the theory that ideals are not fixed but change over time, often dramatically, and end up becoming the exact opposite of what they originally were. For instance an abstraction like ‚Äúgood‚Äù could mean anything depending on who is using it. Wars have been fought, people have been silenced, disease and destruction have been let loose based on what is considered ‚Äúgood‚Äù by certain countries and people in power. Hence, the meaning and interpretation of words really depend on the will that chooses to manipulate them. The will in turn is subject to a shifting and eternally changing viewpoint, based on the power and status of those who operate it. Nietzsche then goes on to propose a new way of thinking that goes beyond such concepts like ‚Äúgood‚Äù and ‚Äúevil.‚Äù

These and other such concepts are a bold and revolutionary way of looking at the way human beings reflect, act and justify their actions. We begin to see the world not in terms of just linear, black and white or binary terms but as a more complex, multidimensional entity, where sometimes contradictory concepts seem to coexist. 

Beyond Good and Evil is divided into nine chapters with an epilogue entitled ‚ÄúAftersong ‚Äì From the High Mountains‚Äù a long narrative poem in which the narrator calls upon his friends to join him on the mountain top. However, when his friends arrive, they don't recognize him. He has become hard and aggressive after living for so long in such inhospitable terrains. They begin to leave one by one and the narrator waits for new friends to arrive, as he realizes that concepts like friendship can never be fixed or eternal. 

Friedrich Nietzsche was born in the old Prussian province of Saxony. His father died when Nietzsche was a child and he was brought up by his mother and her family. He attended a private school with famous contemporaries like Wagner, Krug and Pinder. His interest in music and languages was encouraged by his mother and he joined the Schulpforta where he studied several languages and got a firm grounding in poetry and music. He went on to study theology and philosophy and later joined the Prussian army. He was injured in the war and after leaving the army, began to work as a professor in Basel, Switzerland. From this time on, he was plagued by ill-health and with financial and emotional support from his friends, began to devote time to writing and compiling his thoughts on philosophy. He suffered a mental breakdown and finally died of multiple illnesses in 1900. 

Many great Western philosophers like Heidegger, Foucault and Sartre owe a great deal to Nietzsche other writers like Shaw and Yeats based many of their imaginative writings on his thoughts. Freud was another pioneer who was heavily influenced by Nietzsche's concepts. Beyond Good and Evil is indeed a great addition to your collection of philosophical books."

Medicine,"Welcome to the Doctor Money Matters podcast. 



I am your host Dr. Tarang Patel, a practicing diagnostic radiologist in Phoenix, AZ. 



I started this podcast as a way to share knowledge about financial matters as they relate to health care professionals. We spent many years learning about the science and art of providing patient care but most of us have relatively little knowledge about reaching financial well being. I know that I had no formal training in setting up investment accounts, negotiating contracts, buying insurance, buying real estate, etc. I just learned by reading and also by making many mistakes. Health care professionals are trusted to take put their patients needs first and we in turn assume everyone in other fields work the same way. Unfortunately it is not true. 



By talking about these topics, I hope we can reduce the many financial mistakes that previous generations of doctors have made.  Those physicians were able to overcome these mistakes because of shorter training periods, less debt, and they were more likely to be in private practice. Today we no longer have those luxuries and many of us have significant debt burdens. The good news is that we also have access to information that the prior generation never had. 



A little background about me. As I said before I am a practicing radiologist in Phoenix, AZ. I went to undergrad at Indiana U. (Go Hoosiers), medical school at the Kirksville College of Osteopathic medicine in Missouri, moved east and did my radiology residency at New York Hospital-Weill Cornell Medical Center in Manhattan. I then moved west to serve my Air Force commitment at Nellis AFB in Las Vegas, NV. I then did a fellowship in Body/Musculoskeletal Imaging at Mayo Clinic Arizona. Since I finished training I have been in a hospital employed group for the last 6 years.



I have always enjoyed learning about finance and have read (listened to) many of the financial books. I also spent time reading on the bogleheads.org forum which I found to be a valuable source of information. Finally I just observed that many of my colleagues and I had the same questions about relatively basic financial matters but it was difficult to find clear answers.



Hopefully you find these podcasts useful. I encourage you to subscribe to them, that way you will be updated when any episodes are released automatically. Also please let your friends and colleagues know about this podcast.

After a 5 ¬Ω year career in the Air Force that allowed him to fly F-4 Phantom fighter jets throughout the Far East, he returned to civilian life to become a Learjet charter pilot.
His many flights from South Florida to nearly every island in the Caribbean and most of the Latin American countries was complemented with his chauffeuring of the rich and famous. He flew such celebrities as Jack Nicklaus, John Glenn, Evil Knievel, Jimmy Buffett, Helen Reddy and Olivia Newton-John, as well as Crosby, Stills, Nash and Young. He also smuggled Bob Marley from Kingston, Jamaica when Marley‚Äôs life was in danger.
Ace spent his final 22 years as a Boeing 727 Captain for numerous airlines, most of which went out of business. His 10 airlines in 10 years is likely an unenviable record. The subtitle of his book, The Rogue Aviator is: ""in the back alleys of aviation."" Ace's book provides an insider‚Äôs view of a professional pilot‚Äôs life on the other side of the tracks.}"

Medicine,"The Doctor Paradox is about addressing why despite having incredibly meaningful jobs, doctors are increasingly unhappy in their work. 
Quite simply, it is a tragedy that we have allowed this to happen. That intensely passionate, dynamic and altruistic individuals have lost their core passions and found themselves adrift in the world of healthcare is unacceptable.
The Doctor Paradox focuses on 4 key issues:
1. The factors that explain why doctors are dissatisfied with the world of healthcare.
But more importantly‚Ä¶
2. The physicians that have rediscovered their passions and carved new paths, both within and outside of traditional healthcare.
3. The experts who offer insight on topics related to the challenges faced and the mechanisms to address them such as sleep deprivation, burnout, career advice and philosophical perspectives.
4. The strategies to rediscover your passion, find a new course and pursue what is required to find fulfillment.
A primary responsibility of physicians is to add value and meaning to our patients lives and that of our own.
To fulfill only one of these criteria is not enough. Without value and meaning in our own lives it is almost impossible to provide it to that of our patients.
As physicians, we hold a most privileged position. We intersect with our patients lives, often in their darkest hour, with them asking for our help. For physicians to sustainably provide that help, they must first and foremost help themselves. Not to do so will ultimately degrade one of the most sacred of relationships: that of the patient in need and the doctor who can tend to that need.
The Doctor Paradox also serves to explore a ‚ÄòNew Medicine‚Äô where the traditional model of what it means to be a doctor has changed. That the doctor of the future will still be adding immense value and meaning to patients lives but may be doing so in ways not conventionally pursued before. The physicians of the future will help patients across a spectrum of care, from face to face clinical encounters to designing and developing novel technologies that will significantly impact the lives of patients. For a ‚ÄòNew Medicine‚Äô we need a ‚ÄòNew Doctor‚Äô.
The future of medicine is bright but unless we begin a major course correction, physicians drift toward ever increasing uncertainty.
As the famous saying goes:
‚ÄúThings always get worse‚Ä¶. before they get worse‚Äù.
It is up to us as physicians to effect the changes we wish to see in our own lives and in doing so, ultimately that of our patients.
Things are getting worse, let‚Äôs make them better.
We are ‚Äòstanding on the shoulders of giants‚Äô, so it‚Äôs not that we ought to, it‚Äôs that we have to."

This podcast, hosted by Alessandra Macaluso, author of The Real-Deal Bridal Bible, gives you useful tips for wedding planning and everything you need to know to plan the ultimate wedding that's best for YOU. She and her guests speak about everything: how to get in shape for your wedding, how to communicate with your in-laws and navigate tricky family situations, how to negotiate with vendors, how to plan your wedding budget, what to look for when choosing a reception hall, the best places to honeymoon, what's new in the wedding industry, discounts on bridal and wedding items, how to save money while planning your wedding, relationship advice, how to select your bridal party, and much, much more. 



If you are planning a wedding you'll ask yourself obvious questions, like where would I like to get married? What dress will I wear? And, where should we honeymoon? But unexpected little buggers will also pop up, such as: Why is my bestie acting like she swallowed four Xanax and washed them down with three mimosas? Why does my mom‚Äôs face twitch like that when I talk reception ideas? How come everyone shares opinions, without me asking? And, upon finding yourself locked in a closet: What are the going rates for a room for two at the Little White Wedding Chapel in Vegas? Planning a wedding can be a wonderful time in your life, but it can also be overwhelming. And the whole process has a funny way of bringing out the crazy in everyone around you. The Real-Deal Brides podcast will prepare you for everything you need to know -- the REAL things -- so you can plan the wedding that best reflects you while keeping your sanity, finances, and relationships intact. Whether you are thinking about marriage, are engaged, or are well past your wedding, you will find entertainment and advice in this podcast which you can use long after the last dance. 



This podcast is based off of Alessandra's book, The Real-Deal Bridal Bible, available on Amazon. 



""How I wish I'd had this book to save me back when I got married!! It's the perfect survival guide for not going insane while planning a wedding!"" - Jill Smokler, New York Times Bestselling author of Confessions of a Scary Mommy ""When you're ready for the marriage but fear the drama of planning a wedding, do yourself a favor and read this book. And make sure you stockpile it and do the newly-betrothed in your life a favor by making it their very first engagement gift."" - Kim Bongiorno, New York Times Bestselling author, married since 2003 ""A warm, funny, engaging, and comprehensive guide to planning your big day. This book focuses on all aspects of the event, and also includes intelligent and insightful commentary about the relationship that the wedding will celebrate. Buy for yourself, your sister, your friend, or, if you want to be the cool mother-in-law, for your son's fiance."" - Samantha Rodman, Ph.D, founder of DrPsychMom.com and author of How to Talk to Your Kids About Divorce

He's stuck on a scientific survey mission of indeterminate length, 7.8 light years from Earth. His only company on board the station are stern mission chief Minkowski, insane science officer Hilbert, and Hephaestus Station's sentient, often malfunctioning operating system Hera. He doesn't have much to do for his job other than monitoring static and intercepting the occasional decades-old radio broadcast from Earth, so he spends most of his time creating extensive audio logs about the ordinary, day-to-day happenings within the station. But the Hephaestus is an odd place, and life in extremely isolated, zero gravity conditions has a way of doing funny things to people's minds. Even the simplest of tasks can turn into a gargantuan struggle, and the most ordinary-seeming things have a way of turning into anything but that. Wolf 359 is a radio drama in the tradition of Golden Age of Radio shows. Take one part space-faring adventure, add one part character drama, and mix in one part absurdist sitcom, and you get Wolf 359. New episodes are released every two weeks."

Ring the bell. Rob the moment. Contemplify.

Host, Paul Swanson, is a husband, father and contemplative educator at the Center for Action and Contemplation's Living School**.

The series explores the most intimate human dimensions of the greatest cataclysm in history - a worldwide catastrophe that touched the lives of every family on every street in every town in America - and demonstrates that in extraordinary times, there are no ordinary lives. Throughout the series, the indelible experience of combat is brought vividly to life as veterans describe what it was like to fight and kill and see men die at places like Monte Cassino and Anzio and Omaha Beach; the H√ºrtgen Forest and the Vosges Mountains and the Ardennes; and on the other side of the world at Guadalcanal and Tarawa and Saipan; Peleliu and the Philippine Sea and Okinawa. In all of the battle scenes, dramatic historical footage and photographs are combined with extraordinarily realistic sound effects to give the film a terrifying, visceral immediacy.

Outdoor,"A high altitude mountaineer travels through sub-zero temperatures, scales treacherous terrain, and carries hundreds of pounds of supplies. Many of us have very little in common with this person. We don‚Äôt need to worry about the lack of oxygen in the air or the extent of frostbite in our toes.

Yet, we are all human. There are certain ideas which apply to all of us, no matter if we are standing at 29,029 feet or sea level. Why is it important to step outside of our comfort zone? How do we weigh risk vs. reward? What impact does human behavior have on our decision making? On MtnMeister, we explore these ideas by talking with those who have found answers in the extremes.

Ben Schenck, the host of MtnMeister (pronounced Mountain Meister), asks thought-provoking and sometimes uncomfortable questions that you won't hear in a typical interview. Notable guests include Alex Honnold, Sasha DiGiulian, Ueli Steck, Jeremy Jones, Lynn Hill, Conrad Anker, Aaron Gwin and other adventurers in climbing, skiing, hiking, biking, and everything else in the mountains."

Philosophy,"The title 'Anthem' is derived as an anthem to sense of self and self-governing thoughts.  Anthem is a story of Equality 7-2521 who is a young man living in some unspecified future time and place.  In this future era freedom and individual rights have been eradicated. 

The starring character of the novel is an inquisitive street cleaner.  He lives in a society where people have lost their knowledge of individualism, to the extreme that people do not know words like 'I' or 'mine'.  All the people live and work for their livelihood in collective groups, along with the people with power, namely the 'Councils'.  There are many types of councils namely the Council of Vocations, Council of Scholars etc.  The society is where all the terminology of individualism is completely restrained.  They emphasize the principle that all are equal and should remain that way. 

Equality was an outstanding student during childhood and was very interested in learning.  He wanted to become a scholar in the Council, but for his thought, he was punished by the Council which is responsible for assigning jobs to each individual.  They punished him by assigning him the job of street sweeper. 

Equality had a thirst for knowledge that he secretly satisfy by sneaking into a tunnel every evening, where he was alone. He used the time to write, think and to perform some scientific experiments.  Soon he falls in love with a woman named Liberty 5-3000. 

The book enumerates the quest for knowledge by this young man who struggles to find answers for many burning questions.  These questions lead him to discover the mystery behind his society and the key to freedom.  You'll find the book hard to put down as it tackles the question of expressing love in a society that does not recognize it."

Philosophy,"‚ÄúA man is literally what he thinks, his character being the complete sum of all his thoughts,‚Äù is one of the quotes from James Allen's classic self help books, As a Man Thinketh. Published in 1902, it provides many more such insightful concepts on the power of thought and its effect on a human being's personality and behavior.

This volume is more of a literary essay than a complete book and its title is based on a Biblical proverb, ‚ÄúAs a man thinketh in his heart, so is he.‚Äù Taking this piece of ancient wisdom further, James Allen explores the far-reaching effects of the inner workings of a person's mind and motivation. He proposes that projecting one's own desires, goals and needs in the outer world can provide clues to a person's character.

Thinking and the subconscious mind are assumed to be hidden from the outside world, and hence powerless to change the course of events or circumstances of one's life. However, in this book, Allen presents ideas that can harness this subterranean force and bend our lives to our will if we so choose.

James Allen was a British writer who wrote mostly about everyday philosophy for the lay person and was in a sense, a pioneer of the self help movement. His books and poems were inspirational pieces, meant to help people realize their own powers and take charge of their lives rather than being mere tools in the hands of destiny. Born in a working class family in Leicester, England, Allen and his younger brother grew up in straitened circumstances. His father, a factory worker, traveled to America in search of a better job, but was tragically attacked and killed by criminals in New York. James, the older son, was compelled to leave school and seek work back in England. He found employment as a secretary to a stationer and later worked as a journalist. He later discovered a deep and enduring interest in spiritual matters when he began working as a writer with a magazine devoted to spiritual themes. His first book From Poverty to Power was published in 1901. Subsequently, he also launched his own spiritual magazine.

As a Man Thinketh was his third and most famous book. It became an instant bestseller and the sales of this tiny volume were so great that they allowed Allen and his family to retire to the country, buy a house and live in relative comfort for the rest of their life.

The book's language is very simple and the message presented here will certainly provide a basis for further thought and meditation."

History,"Earth Ancients chronicles the growing (and often suppressed) evidence of known and unknown 
civilizations, their ruined cities, and artifacts developed from advanced science and technology. Erased 
from the pages of time, these cultures discovered and charted the heavens, developed medicine and 
unleashed advancements that parallel and, in many cases, surpass our own. Join us and discover our lost history.
Armed with the thousands of anomalous archeological discoveries which have not been covered by 
conventional science and the media, we can no longer deny our ancient cultural inheritance. Our written 
history is wrong and we‚Äôve been led to believe that humanity is just a few hundred thousand years old. In 
fact, the Hindu Yugas advance the notion that Homo Sapiens are millions of years old, and have lived on 
planet Earth through a series of rebirths.
It‚Äôs now a fact that we are the survivors of a series of cataclysmic events that took place approximately 
12,000 to 14,000 years ago. Our ancestors may have been aware of these impending disasters and fled 
underground shelter, or survived in caves; others may have left the planet, but a huge number perished.      
Though Earth Ancients does explore some of the popular theories that ancient aliens have visited our

planet, our philosophy and research paradigm is decidedly Earth-centric, elevating the historical discourse
about human brilliance and ingenuity found in the archaeological evidence. For example, many of the lost
cultures were able to:

ÔÇ∑ Harness natural electromagnetic field and channel them to build pyramids and colossal buildings

ÔÇ∑ Power tools and machines to shape sculptures and cut water channels

ÔÇ∑ Execute superior scientific and technical abilities lost to modern society"

Social Sciences,"Welcome to ""Unraveling the Secrets.""  My name is Dennis Crenshaw.  My co-host is Rick ""Oz"" Osmon. For the past 45 years we have been researching the connecting links between all things having to do with the secrets and pernicious deeds of a group of secret society outlaws who are working together behind the scenes to create a completely controlled world society with them as bosses and you and I as slaves to their system. This continuing scheme is popularly known as the New World Order, or the NWO.  

Our research actually began with the search for the origin of the so-called UFOs.  My starting point in the mid-60s was the fact that they are real, nuts and bolts craft controlled by advanced civilizations with bases here on earth. The fact that these advanced technological aircraft exists as solid metallic flying machines is based on my personal up-close observation of one.  My early research indicates that MOST of the unexplained airships we see in our skies are from somewhere ON or INSIDE our planet.  This led to my research of the Hollow Earth/ Subterranean Theories in the 1980s-90s which led to my realization that the answers I seek are in the control of a number of elitist groups and secret societies that I call collectively the Controllers.  And as even a quick look at recent worldwide events should convince anyone who is paying attention the Controllers plan is working very well, thank you.  Sometime around 14 years ago I was joined in my research by our co-host, the OZ.  

It is these things and more that we will explore on this radio show.  Join us as we work towards . . . Unraveling the Secrets."

Social Sciences,"How are people affected by overcrowding, traffic congestion, and noise? Why do people litter or vandalize their environments? How do buildings affect their occupants? Does the architectural design of apartment buildings influence patterns of neighboring and friendship formation? Why do people consume scarce environmental resources? Can residential, work, and neighborhood settings be designed to reduce stress, increase productivity, and promote physical activity? These are some of the questions that have concerned environmental psychologists.

Environmental psychology is the study of human behavior and well-being in relation to the large-scale, sociophysical environment. The term, large-scale environment, refers to places such as homes, offices, neighborhoods, and whole communities. These places can be described in terms of several physical and social dimensions, including their geographical location, architectural design, membership and social organization. The term, sociophysical environment, reflects the assumption that the physical and social dimensions of places are closely intertwined. The architectural design of a housing complex, for example, can exert a subtle but substantial impact on the friendship patterns that develop among residents. This course emphasizes the interdependence between physical and social aspects of places, rather than viewing these dimensions as separate and isolated."
